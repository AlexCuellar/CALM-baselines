This folder contains implmenetations of the four baselines used in "An Alignment-Based Approach to Learning Motions from Demonstrations".  Each folder contains a file ```follow_from_csv.py``` (or ```follow_from_csv.m```) which will run the method.  Each folder also contains a "data" folder containing the data for each demonstration set tested in the paper.  Here is an explanation of each method's implementation and how to run them: 

- CLF-CBF_NODE: 
Adapted from https://github.com/farhadnawaz/CLF-CBF-NODE, line 450 allows choosing which dataset to run, and line 453 allows running on a dataset from the LASA Handwriting Dataset.  Lines 354, 370-375 allow to set custom initial points or perturbations on the system.  The folder includes a requirements.txt file.

- DMP:
Adapted from https://github.com/abakisita/ros_dmp/tree/master/pydmps, choosing dataset, inital points, and perturbation are set as command line arguments.  Running on messy_snake may look like: ```python3 follow_from_csv.py -d messy_snake_0_mean``` (recall from the paper that DMPs can only learn from one demonstration, for which we use the TRACER mean trajectory of the demonstrations)

- lpv-ds
Uses code adapted from https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt (the sub-folder phys-gmm must be cloned from https://github.com/nbfigueroa/phys-gmm, see ds-opt README for details).  Running ```follow_from_csv.m``` runs lpv-ds, and the dataset that is chosen from a gui.  Perturbations and initial points are selected lines 54-67.  

- ProMP
Requires installation of https://github.com/dfki-ric/movement_primitives, choosing dataset, initial points, and perturbation are set as command line arguments.  Running on messy_snake may looks like: ```python3 follow_from_csv.py -d messy_snake```
